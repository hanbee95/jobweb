#HAN 20231110 - following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECMB4kUCKWQ, to setup next js
start setup:
    command: npx create-next-app@latest
Question from the command:
    √ What is your project named? ... jobweb
    √ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No / Yes
    √ Would you like to use ESLint? ... No / Yes
    √ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... No / Yes
    √ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... No / Yes
    √ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ... No / Yes
    √ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? ... No / Yes    
nextjs command:
    npm run dev : execute dev environment
    npm run build: build file generation
    npm run start: service start    
hit 'npm run dev' in jobweb dir
-> http://localhost:3000  (In the web, 'Get started by editing src/app/page.tsx' mentioned)
In the Youtube, pages>index.js is the base, but since I used tsx, the path is different: src/app/page.tsx

modified the page.tsx file to only have 'Hello Next.js' in it 

I want to build generation
-> npm run build
-> .next is build file

I want to use the .next (real server start)
-> npm run start

npm run dev (developement)

Route : URL -> how to react UI.
http://a.com/       -> /pages/index.js (in my side: src/app/page.tsx)
http://a.com/sub/   -> /pages/sub/index.js (in my side: src/app/sub/page.tsx)
http://a.com/sub/1  -> /pages/sub/[id].js (in my side: src/app/sub/[id].tsx)

change src/app/page.tsx file: <a href='/sub'> src/app/sub/page.tsx
-> page not found
--> generate 'sub' directory in /src/app/sub, and make page.tsx file.
